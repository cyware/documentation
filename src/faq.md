## What is the difference between Cyware CLI and Cyware Desktop?

The Cyware CLI is self-contained binary that launches the Cyware proxy (also called Instance). You can use it on remote servers or locally and access the Instance using your browser. The Cyware Desktop acts a connection manager to your Instances and can also launch the Cyware proxy in the background. It uses webviews to access the Instance instead of the browser.

::: warning
At the moment, Cyware Desktop is considered experimental and does not perform as well as the browser on Linux.
